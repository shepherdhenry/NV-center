There is a helpful article for understanding NV center.
### Abstract
In this report, we present a detailed and fundamental investigation of the mechanism underlying NV(nitrogen-vacancy) center in diamond, as well as the experimental setup required to achieve such readout. The report begins with an introduction to the electron spin, including the structure of the NV center, the energy levels of the electron, and the optical properties of the NV center. We also discuss the methods used for handling qubits, which are essential for quantum computing applications. Next, we delve into the nuclear spin and its interaction with the electron spin. We discuss the realization of quantum gates and the techniques used for manipulating the nuclear spin. We also explore the conditions required for implementing quantum non-demolition (QND) protocol, which enable single-shot readout of the nuclear spin with high accuracy and minimal disturbance. In addition to the theoretical aspects, we also describe the experimental setup required for achieving single-shot readout of the nuclear spin. Specifically, we discuss the frequency feedback control magnetic stage, which is a critical component for stabilizing the experiment and enabling accurate readout of the nuclear spin.
